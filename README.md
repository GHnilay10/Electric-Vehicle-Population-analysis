#Electric Vehicle Population Registered in Washington Analysis Project Overview

As an intern, I developed a compelling Power BI dashboard to explore the Electric Vehicle (EV) population data in Washington State, utilizing a dataset obtained from the U.S. government's official catalog (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data). The dataset includes the following columns:

- County
- City
- State
- Postal Code
- Model Year
- Manufacturer
- Model
- Electric Vehicle Type
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
- Electric Range
- Base MSRP
- Legislative District
- DOL Vehicle ID
- Vehicle Location
- Electric Utility
- 2020 Census Tract

My analysis focused on establishing relationships among these variables to reveal valuable insights regarding EV ownership patterns, geographic concentrations, and trends within the industry. Key discoveries include:

1. A significant presence of EVs throughout Washington, with a total of approximately 134,000 vehicles according to the dataset.
2. Wide representation of EV brands and models, indicating diverse consumer preferences.
3. Concentration of EVs in certain areas, particularly urban centers such as Seattle and Everett.
4. Correlation between vehicle age, popularity, and pricing.
5. Distribution of eligible vehicles for clean alternative fuels.
6. Visualizations of EV location maps, enabling users to identify hotspots and clusters.

By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I created visually appealing dashboards that facilitate easy exploration and interpretation of the data. My analysis contributes to the broader discussion surrounding the growth of EV markets and the role of public policy in promoting sustainable transportation solutions.
